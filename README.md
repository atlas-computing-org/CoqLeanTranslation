# Port Libraries Between Coq and Lean

## Motivation

Translating existing theorems and proofs from Coq or Lean to the other reduces the silo's between the proof libraries in these communities, allowing each community to leverage the others' work and creating the opportunity to collaborate across traditional language boundaries. For instance, software verification in Lean could benefit from Coq's advanced libraries for software, while Coq could benefit from Lean's math libraries. Having equivalent proofs implemented in different ITPs also provides clear benchmarks for comparing research results across ITPs. LLMs are often good at language translation problems and may provide significant assistance for translation. If LLMs are successful, this could be an early stepping stone to using LLM assistance on more general formalization problems like semantic parsing.

See the [project plan write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VU6O4HxVIlNRRcjY8KoNGtjrurlMtDQbN_gdJDsIq0) for further motivation along with some project planning. (Note, these plans are an incomplete draft.)
